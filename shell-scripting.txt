> CORE BASH SCRIPTING
---------------------
"#!/bin/bash"
"#!/usr/bin/env/bash"            # Different ways of starting a script.
".sh"                            # Default file extension.

$PATH restrictions can cause execution issues for scripts, consider using:
"~/bin" or "/usr/local/bin"

echo $?                          # Shows the last exit code. 0 = Successful.
chmod +x <script>.sh             # Set execute permission before running the script.
./<script>.sh                    # Run the script.

> QUOTING
---------
echo "the value of \$SHELL is $SHELL"    # Use backslash to correctly interpret the first $SHELL variable.

> VARIABLES
-----------
declare                          # Use to see more details about a variable. Use "-p" flag to see attributes and values.
                                 # It can also be used to set an array. See "help declare" for more options.

MYVAR="hello"                    # Creates a variable.
declare -r $MYVAR                # Makes the variable read-only.
MYVAR="bye"                      # Changing the variable will fail due to it being read-only.

MYVAR=                           # Clear the value of a variable.
unset MYVAR                      # Delete variable.

$RANDOM                          # Prints a random number.
$SECONDS                         # Number of seconds that a bash shell has been running.
$LINENO                          # Prints the current line in the script.
$HISTCMD                         # The number of this command in history.
$GROUPS                          # Prints the array containing the groups that the current user is a member of.

> READ
------
read <variable>                  # Stores user input to a variable.
read                             # Automatically stores the user input in $REPLY.
